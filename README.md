# fdf_v2
This project is about creating a simple wireframe model representation of a 3D landscape by linking various points (x, y, z) thanks to line segments (edges).

the fdf program excuted as follows:
./fdf [path_of_the_map_you_want_to_render] (42.fdf for example check the test_maps folder :) )

To have full control on the map after rendring you need to :
Press "P" to change the projection.
Press "+" & "-" to change the altitude.
Press "the four arrow keys" to move the image inside the window.
Press "O" & "I" to zoom out/in
